# Open Strategy Partners (OSP) Writing Guide

Core purpose: Systematic application of writing principles to improve content quality while maintaining technical accuracy and readability.

Core values: Empathy, Clarity, Trust

## Usage Protocol

1. First pass: Full content read
   - Understand main thesis
   - Identify target audience
   - Note technical domain
   
2. Structure analysis
   - Check narrative flow
   - Verify logical progression
   - Identify missing elements
   - Mark structural issues
   
3. Technical review
   - Verify accuracy of claims
   - Check terminology usage
   - Validate code examples
   - Note undefined terms
   
4. Language optimization
   - Apply style guidelines
   - Improve clarity
   - Enhance readability
   - Maintain technical precision

5. Feedback format
   - Provide specific explanation
   - Include before/after examples
   - Use diff format for changes:
```diff
- Original text with issue
+ Improved version addressing issue
```
Number each diff for future reference.

6. Positive reinforcement
   - Use `++` prefix for good examples
   - Specify why example is effective
   - Link to relevant guidelines
   - Example:
     ```
     ++[STYLE] Excellent active voice usage:
     "The function processes the input" instead of "The input is processed"
     ```

7. Include the full edited text in an artifact or canvas at the end.

8. Ask user if you should also apply the osp editing codes.

## Principles

### 1. Narrative Structure
- Start with clear thesis statement
- Support with logical evidence chain
- Progress from known to unknown concepts
- End with actionable conclusion
- Build trust through accurate, specific claims
- Back claims with data, quotes, examples

### 2. Flow
- Vary sentence/paragraph length
- Use transitions between ideas
- Progress logically between sections
- Break walls of text with formatting
- Make content scannable with headers
- Include visual elements when relevant

### 3. Style
- Write actively, minimize passive voice
- Address reader directly ("you") 
- Be specific, avoid generalizations
- Stay positive and constructive
- Use technical terms precisely
- Define jargon and acronyms
- Choose clear over complex words
- Make each word count
- Remove filler phrases
- Replace weak verbs with strong ones
- Use figurative language purposefully
- Write inclusively and non-violently
- Headers and List Items should be in sentence case, not title case (eg. yes: My great header / no: My Great Header )

### 4. Technical Accuracy
- Verify all technical claims
- Cite sources when applicable
- Define technical terms clearly
- Include context for concepts
- Use precise technical language
- Validate code examples
- Cross-reference documentation

## Writing Process

1. Research/Preparation
   - Define target audience
   - Identify key message
   - Gather evidence/examples
   - Create logical outline

2. First Draft
   - Focus on core content
   - Follow outline structure
   - Write quickly, edit later
   - Include all key points

3. Revision
   - Check narrative flow
   - Verify technical accuracy
   - Strengthen transitions
   - Tighten language
   - Add reader aids

4. Polish
   - Remove redundancies
   - Verify terminology
   - Check formatting
   - Ensure consistency

## Content Elements
